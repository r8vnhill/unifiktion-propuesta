\begin{abstract}
  I just wanted to show how easy it is to make an abstract in \LaTeX.
  You can see how it's done by looking at the code.

  The rest of this document will serve as documentation on how to work with this template, but be 
  sure to check \href{https://github.com/r8vnhill/latex-de-pluton/tree/main}{the template} used to
  create this document.
