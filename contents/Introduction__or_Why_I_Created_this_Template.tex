\section{Introduction (or Why I Created this Template)}
  This template was born because there's one big problem with \LaTeX: it's very difficult to start
  learning it.
  But the thing is, it's not because \LaTeX\ is overcomplicated, it's because there's little to no
  material to learn.

  This is an ambitious task, because I want you to be able to use this template as-is with minimal
  \LaTeX\ knowledge, but also give you the tools to learn it and to understand how this template is
  made.
  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an advanced \LaTeX\ user, this template is aimed at 
  everyone.
