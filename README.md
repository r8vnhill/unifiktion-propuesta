A flexible, lightweight and simple(ish) LATEX template (aimed mainly for academic documents).
Because you wouldn't kill a fly with a missile, you don't need an over-complex template to write 
your assignments.

## Introduction (or Why I Created this Template)
This template was born because there's one big problem with LATEX: it's very difficult to start
learning it.
But the thing is, it's not because LATEX is overcomplicated, it's because there's little to no
material to learn.

This is an ambitious task, because I want you to be able to use this template as-is with minimal
LATEX knowledge, but also give you the tools to learn it and to understand how this template is
made.
It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or an advanced LATEX user, this template is aimed at 
everyone.

## How to use

For usage instructions, please refer to the ``Documentation.pdf`` file included on this repository.
